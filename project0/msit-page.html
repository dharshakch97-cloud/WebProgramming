            <p>I have finished my graduation in 2019 and now pursuing my post-graduation at MSIT.</p>
            <p>I came to knew about this course through my brother, who's friend is a graduated from here</p>
            <p>I want say about this MSIT course. This Two year course allows students to improve their technical knowledge.
                Apart from technical knowledge, they also focus on improve programming skills</p>
            <p>Features of MSIT:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Learning by doing concepts</li>
                <li>Programming in Hackerrank</li>
                <li>Improve soft skills</li>
            </ul>
